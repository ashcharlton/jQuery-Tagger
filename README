What is jQuery-Tagger?

jQuery-Tagger is a simple to use tag creation feature using a text box.

How to use it?

Be sure to include the Jquery library, as well as the EMSwitchBox javascript, and css file in your tag. Make sure you load Jquery before you load jQuery-Tagger.
Now you must initialize the plugin. 

Add a html element you wish to contain the tagger. Then initialise with $('#ID_OF_ELEMENT').tagger();
